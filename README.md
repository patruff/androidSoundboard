# Soundboard

## Pat's log
DONE
- Solved the issue with generating .wav code (now just run python process_wavs.py in the res/raw

- Fixed menu such that individual letters create their own pages in the app

## Features:

    - Samples that will be chosen from should be selectable
    - Minimum of one (the same sound played at random intervals)
- Free
- Open Source
- No Ads
- No Trackers
